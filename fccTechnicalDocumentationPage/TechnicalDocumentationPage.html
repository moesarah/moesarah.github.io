          <p>A song about a heart break I loved before I even knew what a heart break was.</p>
          <p>When I was just 13/14 years old this song inspired me to write my first novel. And I still have it. Even though it is awful to read and I would rather die than show this draft to anyone. But I lived for the characters and hearing this song always gives me back all the memories.</p>
          <p>Besides that this song was the first song I learned to play on my guitar.</p>

          <p>This is my "Chuck and Blair" song. The first couple in television I was a fan of.</p>
          <p>Back then when I was a teenage girl and had my first iPod Nano I listned to this song on repeat for hours. There was a time in my life in which I fall asleep to this song every night for <em>weeks</em>. I remember one day the total number of plays in my iTunes was something over 9000. </p>

          <p>I don't have any specific memory linked with this song. I think while the other songs where all linked to fictional storys and characters this one belongs just to myself. Since 2006 until now this song was and is always in my playlist. And even when it is somehow a little dark and twisted: Listening to this song somehow always feels a little bit like home.</p>

          <p>The last song of Grey's Anatomy before Cristina left. Before this awesome series becomes unbearable and unbelievably bad. And this somehow broke my heart. The most beautiful friendship that stood over every love story started with this song when Cristina called Meredith "my person" for the first time. And I was totally addicted to the "Twisted Sisters".</p>
          <p>The end of Meredith and Cristina was just as painfull as Mark and Lexie's death and ended with the same song it started with. This song always gives me<em>feelings</em>. (When you click on the song you will noticed I did not give you just the song but the whole "Twisted Sisters"-ending scene)</p>

          <p>Jesse McCartney, of course. He has to be part of this list. But it's not "Beautiful Soul" (which is also an amazing song) it's "We Can Go Anywhere". This song feels like sommer and freedom.</p>
          <p>Remember the awful novel I mentioned at the beginning? This song was part of my writing-playlist. And while Breakeven gave me all the sad feelings this song stood for fun and always gives me warm feelings.</p>
